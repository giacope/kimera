# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Fix a boot crash on case-sensitive filesystems (Linux): `require "English"`
  was spelled `require "english"`.

## 0.1.0 (2026-09-26)

Initial public release.

- Schemata-based mutation testing for Ruby and Rails. All mutants for a file
  compile into one guarded-dispatch program and are selected at runtime, so the
  suite loads once and mutants flip in a warm process.
- Warm worker pool (`--jobs N`) pulling from one shared, heaviest-first queue,
  with opt-in per-mutant transaction rollback (`--isolate-db`), cache resets,
  per-worker test databases, and a hard-killable watchdog.
- Covering tests run most-recent-killer first, cutting test executions without
  narrowing the measured covering set.
- Diff-driven incremental mode (`--since`) with resumable sessions and CI
  gating (`--max-survivors`, `--max-errors`, `--fail-on-no-coverage`).
- Isolated mode (`--isolated`): each mutant baked into a fresh tree and judged
  in a clean subprocess.
- RSpec and Minitest adapters, including `before(:suite)` / `after(:suite)`
  hooks. `--exclude-test GLOB` drops unrunnable test files. A red baseline
  prints how to reproduce it without Kimera.
- Low-noise default operators, plus extended and Rails-aware families
  (`--operators all`). These include contract operators (`index_fetch`,
  `kernel_coercion`, `respond_to_guard`, `symbol_literal`, `default_argument`)
  and `chain_link_deletion` (`a.where(x).recent.first` => `a.where(x).first`).
- Harness failures get their own `harness_error` status and never count as
  kills.
- Equivalent-mutant ignore list: a reason is required, `max_ignored` budgets
  it, `column:` pins ambiguous lines, and a warning fires when an entry no
  longer matches any mutant.
- `kimera skill` prints a bundled guide for AI coding agents: how to run,
  triage, and gate with Kimera, and the rules against gaming the score.
  `kimera init` points agents to it from `AGENTS.md`.
- Kimera holds itself to zero surviving mutants: the full warm self-host run
  gates at `max_survivors: 0`, with harness-critical files judged in the
  isolated tier.
